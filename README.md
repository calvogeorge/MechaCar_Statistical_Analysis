## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
According to our results, vehicle_length and ground_cleareance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. Meaning that these variables have significant impact in the mpg of the MechaCar.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, there is a relationship between the variables and the MechaCar mpg, as evidence by the Pearson correlation coefficient's r-value of 0.7149 there is strong positive correlation between our variables.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Based on the previous two answers a linear model can effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
